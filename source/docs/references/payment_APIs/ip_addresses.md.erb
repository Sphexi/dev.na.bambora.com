# IP Addresses

## Domains

Bambora uses the following fully qualified domain names to interact with your integration:

```
api.na.bambora.com
web.na.bambora.com
```

## IP Addresses

Here is the full list of IP addresses that `api.na.bambora.com` and `web.na.bambora.com` can resolve to:

```

```
⚠️ Please be sure to always use the `api.na.bambora.com` or `web.na.bambora.com` DNS names to contact our APIs — never communicate with an IP Address directly.

## Response Notifications

If your integration is configured to receive Response Notifications from Bambora, you should ensure these events also originate from one of our listed IP Addresses above.
